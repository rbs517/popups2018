# FLUTO
### Fluto is an interactive installation where you can conduct a live-visual symphony with others by blowing into your mobile device.

Fluto is a life-size “flute-like” instrument where people can play together by visiting fluto.us on their mobile devices. Once on the web-app, the user chooses a color that corresponds to the same color tube as the instrument, and gently blows into his/her phone’s microphone to see the ball inside the chosen colored tube flow to the top of the tube. In addition, when chosen, each tube plays a different sound. With Fluto, people can use their breath and their mobile devices together as a tool for creating an audio-visual symphony.
